188,,"So, here's how it's used:

Let's say we need to create a volume.

We know the CloudStack account the volume is associated with. We use this info when calling SolidFireUtil.getSolidFireAccountName to find the name of the SolidFire account that should support this CloudStack account (such a SolidFire account may not exist at this point).

We then use the String that comes back from SolidFireUtil.getSolidFireAccountName and look up the SolidFire account (making an API call to the SolidFire SAN).

If it returns a SolidFire account, we use it. Otherwise, we create a SolidFire account with that name and use it.","before = after, contributor's comment",True,getSolidFireAccountName,-,https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/commit/73608dec28b5a524743ac74b776b8778bb540e28,no,,,contributor's answer,related to comment at line 183,314,plugins/storage/volume/solidfire/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/storage/datastore/util/SolidFireUtil.java

1) ServiceLoader processors (captured by serviceIterator.hasNext())
2) -processor processors

If we don't check for options.getProcessors() here and there are no service processors present, we'd never run the preprocessing step, even if we specify the -processor flag. This is why I'm currently checking both here and running pre-processing if either is present (which tests corroborate).

There is a slight change to the way j2objc currently operate, as the -processor flag is currently ignored and will now override any ServiceLoader processor, due to the interface defined by javac (and also documented in the j2objc -help documentation of the -processor flag)","Irrelevant comment, contributor's comment",True,processAnnotations,-,https://github.com/google/j2objc/commit/a87bbf0d293fb40ef1f0d052fa177f977f67d091,no,,,contributor's answer,,247,translator/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/j2objc/javac/JavacParser.java

I've just looked a bit deeper into this class and I think there is one think we could improve: instead of just taking the first open project here, we could pass the project to `registerGerritPushTargetPanel` (you can get it from the GitRepository instance where this method is called and keep a reference in the `gerritPushTargetPanels` (probably create a simple class for holding both branchName and project as entry)).

But I'm not really sure anymore how this class works with multiple projects open at the same time. It's not really nice code, but I've not found a better way to do it because there is absolutely no API for extending the push dialog.

Can you please try this and do extensive tests with opening multiple projects at the same time, then close one, try the push dialog again and so on?

 But some customers ingest agent logs into the app, and those are billed, so I'm pretty sure we shouldn't log at the warn level. As to adding a flag like that, it could work. Printing it just once might not be enough though, especially with the log rotation. Maybe lowering it to `debug` is enough, or if you want to make it stand out in `warn`, you could maybe use an integer and set a desired frequency to skip, and print every N iterations or something - it would add some overhead, but only for the bad types so maybe not the end of the world.",too long instance,True,sendMetrics,src/main/java/org/datadog/jmxfetch/reporter/Reporter.java,https://github.com/DataDog/jmxfetch/commit/b097d5e824f65e204b612d5317bb95eb47bc9ce9,yes,,yes,,related to discussion starting at line 358,126,src/main/java/org/datadog/jmxfetch/reporter/Reporter.java
