,"A few questions:
 1. @aphyr Are you sure you actually want to support the case that the reverse DNS lookup for the local machine the code is running on has changed? How often does that happen ? Wouldn't it just confuse the riemann user more that the same stream now has a different hostname ? Aren't we better off, with performing the lookup only once?
 2. @lassic Given we do want to refresh the hostname... why are we refreshing the hostname only if it is null or empty? According to aphyr's requirement on #45 the getLocalHost() should be called every time interval (assuming no env variables).
 3. @aphyr - Isn't it advisable for getResolvedHostname() to have predictable low latency 100% of the calls? In that respect a separate thread is a good idea since the user's (low latency) thread is never used for performing a DNS call (with unpredictable latency). As for the teardown concern for the timer thread... doesn't client.scheduler() internals already take care of the teardown?",FALSE,refreshResolve,src/main/java/com/aphyr/riemann/client/LocalhostResolver.java,https://github.com/riemann/riemann-java-client/commit/964539ae1ab974e9ba3b8361f63cacc317ffd5ca,no,,,,,answer to discussion (see line 18)

 2. Yeah, I agree we should refresh each time.

https://github.com/DataBiosphere/consent-ontology/pull/70,"consider an alternate approach that removes the need for `TermResourceMinimalDeserializer` altogether. What if, instead of conditionally applying a json deserializer, you always use the full/built-in deserializer, but add one of these blocks here:
 
 ```
 
  if (thinFilter) {
 
  List<TermResource> thinList = new ArrayList<TermResource>();
 
  for (TermResource thick : termList) {
 
  TermResource thin = new TermResource();
 
  thin.setId(thick.id);

  thin.setSynonyms(thick.synonyms);
 
  thinList.add(thin);

  thick.setUsable(null);

 I am waffling on what is the best approach. Using a different deserializer is the most efficient at runtime, in that we only deserialize the fields we need from ES, and we don't create Java objects we won't use. However, managing deserializers is heavier on code maintenance, whereas massaging Java objects is probably more readable/accessible code.",TRUE,executeSearch,-,https://github.com/DataBiosphere/consent-ontology/commit/db781a3e9e34f74727f7ef19ef6f48ee5ccc9072,,,,,,

,"I think it should be `if (whatever) { shorter branch; } else { longer branch; }`
 
 
 
 Of course, if `shorter branch` ends with `return` or `break` or `continue`, then `else` is not required, and it helps to minimize indentation level for `longer branch`
 
 
 
 Of course that might depend on case-by-case basis, however most of the times it helps to put shorter fragments first, so the nesting is easier to identify.
 
 
 
 On top of that, negated conditions are typically harder to understand, so the following would be so much better than the current code in `master`:
 
 
 
 ```
 
 if (success) {
 
  prevResult = sResult;
 
  prevTime = currentTime;
 
  continue;
 
 }
 
 // Set failure message and stop the search

,"```
 
 ....
 
 ...
 
 break;
 
 ```
 
 
 
 is complicated in any case, so adding yet another nesting layer does not really help there.
 
 
 
 Moving some of the code to a smaller method would clarify the intention much better than adding `else`.
 
 
 
 You do touch that code, that is why I raise the concerns.
